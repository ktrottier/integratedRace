integratedRace
==============

Race in javascript nested in html format

A basic race game where the player can bet on 1 of the 2 contestants competing and double their money or lose it altogether.

*HTML layout/design + JS tag attribute assignments.  Changed START button size and feature to turn into RUN!!! button after initial click. by Kevin Trottier


Simplify the gamble function, clean up the codes, add comments, disable the 4 input boxes so player cannot type (which would lead to the game not running correctly), the game is won when one of the contestant reaches the distance. by Austin @  Sunday Aug 10, 12.50pm.
